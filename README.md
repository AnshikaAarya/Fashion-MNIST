# Fashion MNIST Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying clothing images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset using machine learning models. Fashion MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset but contains images of clothing items rather than handwritten digits.

## Introduction
The **Fashion MNIST** dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, each depicting one of 10 different categories of clothing, such as t-shirts, trousers, and dresses. The goal of this project is to classify each image into one of the predefined categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following categories:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) or access it via popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the Data:**  
   Use `data_preprocessing.py` to load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset, normalize the images, and split the data into training and test sets.
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model:**  
   Train a machine learning or deep learning model by running `model.py`. The script contains code for training various models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or basic classifiers like Logistic Regression.
   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```

3. **Jupyter Notebooks:**  
   You can also explore the data and experiment with models interactively by running the provided Jupyter notebooks.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
   ```

## Model
This project includes implementations of several models, including:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** A deep learning model that achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks.
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** A basic feedforward neural network.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A classical machine learning model.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method for classification.

### Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate the performance of the models using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Results
Our best-performing model, a CNN, achieved an accuracy of over 92% on the test set. The following table summarizes the results for each model:

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| CNN                 | 92.5%    | 91.6%     | 92.3%  | 92.1%    |
| MLP                 | 89.2%    | 88.4%     | 89.0%  | 88.7%    |
| SVM                 | 88.1%    | 87.5%     | 88.0%  | 87.7%    |
| Random Forest       | 86.4%    | 85.9%     | 86.3%  | 86.1%    |
